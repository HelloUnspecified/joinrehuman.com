  - clientName: "Joshua Berrios"
    clientPosition: "Founder @ Redemptive Software"
    clientWords: "Clark was not only instrumental in my novice speaking career in the Summer of 2024 but a pinnacle mentor when I got laid off from my Software Engineer role and was thinking of starting my own development company. He was real, raw, and also encouraging. He helped me develop a starting game plan and provided insights from when he started his own thing. Shortly after, I started to gain traction and now run development efforts for 3-4 clients."

  - clientName: "Israa Taha"
    clientPosition: "Product Engineer @ Vibrant"
    clientWords: "Having watched Clark take the stage at THAT Conference in Wisconsin every year since 2013, inspiring thousands of developers with his energy and insights, I already knew how impactful his guidance could be. Getting the chance to work with him one-on-one has been a transformative experience. Clark helped me focus on what truly brings me joy and energy, guiding me toward a clear vision of what I want to achieve. He is not just about offering insights—he is about creating momentum. Clark asks the tough questions to help you cut through the noise and set meaningful goals while providing the accountability you need to take action and make real progress toward those goals. From the start, he has been an incredible advocate, mentor, cheerleader, and someone I am honored to call a friend."

  - clientName: "Ryan Furrer"
    clientPosition: "Design Engineer @ Pragma"
    clientWords: "Clark Sell is a one-of-a-kind human being who will inspire you, motivate you, and bring out the best in you. I met Clark when I was lucky enough to attend THAT Conference in Round Rock, TX, in January 2024. THAT Conference was life-changing for me and countless others; however, it’s the vision of the man behind THAT which made it so. After THAT, I had several conversations with Clark – almost none of which were surface-level. Clark was never afraid to be vulnerable, honest, and real. Clark’s life experience is what makes him such a great mentor. However, Clark, as a person, combined with his life experience, is what makes him a phenomenal one. You owe it to yourself to work with Clark. He is a one-of-a-kind human being with the brains, experience, and know-how to elevate you to the next level."

  - clientName: "Ellie Zubrowski"
    clientPosition: "Developer Advocate @ Pieces for Developers"
    clientWords: "Clark is one of the main reasons I am where I am today. He was the reason I got to go to my first tech conference (THAT Conference TX in 2024), and his advice during a coaching session had a huge impact on me landing my first job in tech. He pushed me to introduce myself to strangers, stop hiding behind an anonymous cartoon character, and take my health seriously. One of my favorite things he says is: “Don’t try to solve other people’s problems, just share your own experience” (or something like that). I’ll always be thankful to Clark for the impact he’s had on my life and the tech community as a whole."

  - clientWords: Clark is an insightful and kind leader who has given me valuable advice on everything from community organizing to conference speaking. He has a rare mixture of deep technical and community-organizing expertise. From our 1:1s, I particularly appreciated his empathetic approach to crafting talk narratives from understanding the audience perspective. Clark is a must-have person to work with, and I cannot recommend him enough. Thank you again, Clark!
