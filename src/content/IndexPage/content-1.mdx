Fifteen years ago, I started a small experiment called THAT Conference. What began as a side project for software folks became something bigger, a family, a community, a living system of people who showed up not just to learn code, but to belong.

We built it all ourselves. Every line of code, every event, every late-night hallway conversation. And somewhere between the talks and the tacos, I learned something that no amount of engineering ever taught me:

**When we connect, we build faster. When we trust, we create braver things. When we belong, we stay.**
