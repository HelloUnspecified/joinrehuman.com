Fifteen years ago, I started a small experiment called THAT Conference.

What began as a side project for software folks became something bigger — a family, a community, a living system of people who showed up not just to learn code, but to belong.

We built it all ourselves.
Every line of code, every event, every late-night hallway conversation.
And somewhere between the talks and the tacos, I learned something that no amount of engineering ever taught me:

<Bold>Humans are the real infrastructure.</Bold>

When we connect, we build faster.
When we trust, we create braver things.
When we belong, we stay.

Then the world shifted.

Artificial intelligence exploded into our workflows, our conversations, our decisions. The tools got smarter, the systems more efficient — but many of us felt something quietly unravel.

We became more connected online and yet somehow more apart in life.

Work became a feed, not a feeling.

Culture became content.

Community became a calendar invite.

So here we are, at the edge of another revolution.

AI is not the problem. Disconnection is.

It’s not that machines are taking over — it’s that we’re forgetting what it means to be human alongside them.

<Bold>That’s why I’m launching re:Human.</Bold>
